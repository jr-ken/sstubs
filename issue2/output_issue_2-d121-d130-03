Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",

Groovy has this problem when the groovy class is loaded through the false classloader. For example when you have class A and class B extends A, and then you try to load class B through the GroovyClassLoader. The class B may be available on the normal classpath, so  the class is not loaded through the groovy clasloader but through the APPLoader. This is ok as long as the class A is on the classpath too. If class A is only available for the groovy loader, for example because the file is not compiled, then you will have this problem. The APPLoader is always there, but is not able to compile groovy files.\n",
