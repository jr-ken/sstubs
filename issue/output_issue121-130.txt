It no longer makes sense for directories to be part of task inputs because a deep search is always performed with this PR, meaning if there are files under the directory, they will be included.\r\n\r\nI tried a [naive implementation by filtering](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/6019/files#diff-edfeef99fdd02fa0f9b1fdd18d7ed580), but that's obviously the wrong way to do it because it will be bad for performance and it breaks relative path sensitivity.

All the fingerprints would then be reported as added. That has the advantage that we don't need to walk the file system again, since we already have the fingerprints of the input files.\r\n\r\nPlease remove the changes related to `optional` and input file validation from this PR or create a new one.",

It shows the missing project configuration context in the case of nested configurations.\r\n\r\nI added a build operations for the nested project configuarations (via `Project.allprojects()`, `Project.subprojects()`, `Project.project()`). This is done directly inside `DefaultProject` as the config actions are directly excuted from there. I wonder if we should add a _ProjectConfigurationService_ as intermediate step and wrap that in a _BuildOperationProjectConfigurationService_. I.e., instead of calling `ConfigureUtil.configure()` directly, do that through such a service. Injecting an additional service into `DefaultProject` however seems to be rather clumsy as we have to go through `ProjectFactory` and so on. Maybe `GradleInternal` could provide the service.\r\nhttps://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/1033/commits/7b58a3ed0c9ca64693ba7be826b5d5d7c9323842#diff-421664408d352dfb47b0785a797100bf\r\n\r\nIn the case of init script plugins: It is still not obvious where the `apply` comes from, as the actual configuration happens not where it is declared.

It shows the missing project configuration context in the case of nested configurations.\r\n\r\nI added a build operations for the nested project configuarations (via `Project.allprojects()`, `Project.subprojects()`, `Project.project()`). This is done directly inside `DefaultProject` as the config actions are directly excuted from there. I wonder if we should add a _ProjectConfigurationService_ as intermediate step and wrap that in a _BuildOperationProjectConfigurationService_. I.e., instead of calling `ConfigureUtil.configure()` directly, do that through such a service. Injecting an additional service into `DefaultProject` however seems to be rather clumsy as we have to go through `ProjectFactory` and so on. Maybe `GradleInternal` could provide the service.\r\nhttps://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/1033/commits/7b58a3ed0c9ca64693ba7be826b5d5d7c9323842#diff-421664408d352dfb47b0785a797100bf\r\n\r\nIn the case of init script plugins: It is still not obvious where the `apply` comes from, as the actual configuration happens not where it is declared.

    "body": "I added test coverage to show the _is_ state without more additional operations. It shows the missing project configuration context in the case of nested configurations.\r\n\r\nI added a build operations for the nested project configuarations (via `Project.allprojects()`, `Project.subprojects()`, `Project.project()`). This is done directly inside `DefaultProject` as the config actions are directly excuted from there. I wonder if we should add a _ProjectConfigurationService_ as intermediate step and wrap that in a _BuildOperationProjectConfigurationService_. I.e., instead of calling `ConfigureUtil.configure()` directly, do that through such a service. Injecting an additional service into `DefaultProject` however seems to be rather clumsy as we have to go through `ProjectFactory` and so on. Maybe `GradleInternal` could provide the service.\r\nhttps://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/1033/commits/7b58a3ed0c9ca64693ba7be826b5d5d7c9323842#diff-421664408d352dfb47b0785a797100bf\r\n\r\nIn the case of init script plugins: It is still not obvious where the `apply` comes from, as the actual configuration happens not where it is declared.

It shows the missing project configuration context in the case of nested configurations.\r\n\r\nI added a build operations for the nested project configuarations (via `Project.allprojects()`, `Project.subprojects()`, `Project.project()`). This is done directly inside `DefaultProject` as the config actions are directly excuted from there. I wonder if we should add a _ProjectConfigurationService_ as intermediate step and wrap that in a _BuildOperationProjectConfigurationService_. I.e., instead of calling `ConfigureUtil.configure()` directly, do that through such a service. Injecting an additional service into `DefaultProject` however seems to be rather clumsy as we have to go through `ProjectFactory` and so on. Maybe `GradleInternal` could provide the service.\r\nhttps://github.com/gradle/gradle/pull/1033/commits/7b58a3ed0c9ca64693ba7be826b5d5d7c9323842#diff-421664408d352dfb47b0785a797100bf\r\n\r\nIn the case of init script plugins: It is still not obvious where the `apply` comes from, as the actual configuration happens not where it is declared.

    "body": "@riemenschneider Thank you for the work you did so far. I took a closer look at this pull request and here are my comments:\n- Annotate new fields in TestNGOptions with @Incubating. This is what we always do for new stuff in the API. \n- Use primitive boolean type for new fields in TestNGOptions. This is what we normally do in other places and it will make the code a little bit safer and simpler. Let's default to what was previously used for backward compatibility (both values false when not explicitly set to true)\n- One integration test case per new option should be perfectly enough. These tests are very slow, especially when executed for multiple versions. You could try to combine similar test cases and rely on unit tests to verify default values and corner cases.\n- Last two test cases for preserveOrder and groupByInstances are almost identical. It would be good to use specific [minimal fixture](http://xunitpatterns.com/Minimal%20Fixture.html) so that both tests clearly document what each option is about. If this comment sounds too vague please let me know and I'll be happy to help you to come up with better test cases.\n- Remove TextUtil.toPlatformLineSeparators when checking output in the integration test. This causes tests to fail on Windows because output is normalized to use Unix style newlines.\n- Update user guide under \"23.13\". A new section called something like \"Controlling test execution order in TestNG\" should do the trick.\n",

    "body": "@riemenschneider Thank you. There are two major problems with the corrections you made:\n- New integration tests fail when executed against multiple TestNG versions. Note that the \"org.gradle.integtest.multiversion\" property needs to be set to \"all\" in order to run tests against multiple versions\n- Documentation can't be generated. You can verify that using command \"gradlew :docs:docs\"\n\nAlso, I noticed that you made a comment in the user guide that Gradle's overrides TestNG defaults in regards to preserving test execution order. This is not our intention. The documentation says that tests run in the order they are found in the XML file by default (when preserve-order attribute is not set). However when I checked org.testng.TestNG class which Gradle uses to run tests it explicitly sets this attribute to false. In case the defaults vary between TestNG versions we should reconsider how these new values are set. It would be great if you could do some research into that. In general we want to avoid introducing changes that are not backward compatible. If someone uses specific TestNG version with Gradle now we don't want test execution order to change when when they upgrade Gradle. \n",

Using that way a NoSuchMethodException is more or less the way TestNG is handling the situation (the method is not there and if you try to call it using reflection, you get a NSME).\n\nOn the other hand TestNG is mostly configured using a testng.xml file and if this XML configuration contains an unknown attribute, it is simply (and silently) ignored.\n\nI have currently implemented the first way (try to set the option and if that fails AND the option is true, throw the caught exception) in order to inform the user about the fact, that is was not possible to run the test suite as it was specified. Unfortunately I am not able to pass the option to TestNG and propagate failures since there are not methods for passing the options.\n",

In this case we would have to handle the NSME, the question is whether we fail the build or not. I don't have super strong feelings on this either way but in general I'm not a huge fan of silently ignoring errors. I think returning an error indicating to the user that the option isn't available on the version of TestNG they are using seems reasonable.

    "body": "@riemenschneider Thank you for the work you did so far. I took a closer look at this pull request and here are my comments:\n- Annotate new fields in TestNGOptions with @Incubating. This is what we always do for new stuff in the API. \n- Use primitive boolean type for new fields in TestNGOptions. This is what we normally do in other places and it will make the code a little bit safer and simpler. Let's default to what was previously used for backward compatibility (both values false when not explicitly set to true)\n- One integration test case per new option should be perfectly enough. These tests are very slow, especially when executed for multiple versions. You could try to combine similar test cases and rely on unit tests to verify default values and corner cases.\n- Last two test cases for preserveOrder and groupByInstances are almost identical. It would be good to use specific [minimal fixture](http://xunitpatterns.com/Minimal%20Fixture.html) so that both tests clearly document what each option is about. If this comment sounds too vague please let me know and I'll be happy to help you to come up with better test cases.\n- Remove TextUtil.toPlatformLineSeparators when checking output in the integration test. This causes tests to fail on Windows because output is normalized to use Unix style newlines.\n- Update user guide under \"23.13\". A new section called something like \"Controlling test execution order in TestNG\" should do the trick.\n",

    "body": "@riemenschneider Thank you. There are two major problems with the corrections you made:\n- New integration tests fail when executed against multiple TestNG versions. Note that the \"org.gradle.integtest.multiversion\" property needs to be set to \"all\" in order to run tests against multiple versions\n- Documentation can't be generated. You can verify that using command \"gradlew :docs:docs\"\n\nAlso, I noticed that you made a comment in the user guide that Gradle's overrides TestNG defaults in regards to preserving test execution order. This is not our intention. The documentation says that tests run in the order they are found in the XML file by default (when preserve-order attribute is not set). However when I checked org.testng.TestNG class which Gradle uses to run tests it explicitly sets this attribute to false. In case the defaults vary between TestNG versions we should reconsider how these new values are set. It would be great if you could do some research into that. In general we want to avoid introducing changes that are not backward compatible. If someone uses specific TestNG version with Gradle now we don't want test execution order to change when when they upgrade Gradle. \n",

Using that way a NoSuchMethodException is more or less the way TestNG is handling the situation (the method is not there and if you try to call it using reflection, you get a NSME).\n\nOn the other hand TestNG is mostly configured using a testng.xml file and if this XML configuration contains an unknown attribute, it is simply (and silently) ignored.\n\nI have currently implemented the first way (try to set the option and if that fails AND the option is true, throw the caught exception) in order to inform the user about the fact, that is was not possible to run the test suite as it was specified. Unfortunately I am not able to pass the option to TestNG and propagate failures since there are not methods for passing the options.\n",

In this case we would have to handle the NSME, the question is whether we fail the build or not.

I think returning an error indicating to the user that the option isn't available on the version of TestNG they are using seems reasonable.
